# test

Requires Unity 5
Before opening the project, please remove the "builds"-folder out of the assets folder! 

The aim is to destroy the Unity Engine (the Unity-Logo). The Logo is surrounded by obstacles, that you have to destroy before you can
reach the logo. In the Projectiles folder at the left, you can select different projectiles that you can fire at the obstacles. 
Every shot projectile takes points away from the score.
Every destroyed obstacle gives you points.
If you hit an obstacle with the matching projectile, it will also destroy the obstacles, that are next to it and give you more points.
You will notice that there is one projectile that you cannot select. This is the one you need to finally destroy unity.
It will become available after you reached a certain score and turned all trees pink by shooting a "not assigned value"projectile 
at them. It is recommended to do this before you reach a score of 120.....
